<p>I’m a lifelong learner, builder, and coach who thrives at the intersection of creativity, systems thinking, and execution. Most of my early projects, built with Make, n8n, and other low and no-code tools, were never documented because they were driven by curiosity, self-improvement, and the joy of learning rather than a need for a portfolio. If I could, I’d stay in school forever — exploring, experimenting, and building. Today, I’m deepening my technical foundation, embracing code and engineering practices to complement my automation experience and better serve the problems I tackle. Beyond building, I coach startup founders in New York and Silicon Valley on developing agency around testing, iteration, and learning loops, teaching through military-inspired frameworks like MDMP, the targeting process, and the OODA loop to help them think and act decisively. I believe we live in a world where you can “just do things,” and that the only limits are your willingness to learn, embrace feedback, and iterate when you’re wrong. This repository showcases some of my journey, though my robust build portfolio on the Palantir Maven Smart Systems platform cannot be displayed here due to its nature.</p>
