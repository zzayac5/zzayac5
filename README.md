<p>I’m a lifelong learner, builder, and coach who thrives at the intersection of creativity, systems thinking, and execution. Most of my early projects, built with Make, n8n, and other low and no-code tools, were never documented because they were driven by curiosity, self-improvement, and the joy of learning rather than a need for a portfolio. If I could, I’d stay in school forever — exploring, experimenting, and building. Today, I’m deepening my technical foundation, embracing code and engineering practices to complement my automation experience and better serve the problems I tackle. Beyond building, I coach startup founders in New York and Silicon Valley on developing agency around testing, iteration, and learning loops, I will use military-inspired analogies from frameworks like MDMP, the targeting process, and the OODA loop to help them think and act decisively. Coaching is not about telling someone what to do or teaching them, it is about listening and asking questions to help them teach themselves. I believe we live in a world where you can “just do things,” and that the only limits are your willingness to learn, embrace feedback, and iterate when you’re wrong. This repository showcases some of my journey, though many of my projects are not hosted here.</p>
<h2>👨‍💻 Self Development Projects:</h2>
- <b>Python through projects</b>
    <p>These are made on the code in place platform or are code that I "committed" to github without knowing git. This means the code bases are not fully pythonic and there are special that needed to be used to build these. But I wanted to put them here because these were not guided projects or youtube tutorials but engineering thinking and making something from nothing. No substack, no vibe coding. Just me and my laptop making something</p>

  - [AI TO DO LIST](https://github.com/zzayac5/Ai-to-do-list)
  - <p> Code will be mostly ai generated within my generation. Learning the syntax and how to THINK through the solutions and what the software can and cannot do is important. But it is also important to learn how to iterate with this new technology, build faster, debug with AI and iterate on a feature. So I am trying to build an entirely AI generated application (with guardrails) locally on a home hosted server. To help me learn how AI codes, and compare that to what I am learning on my software dev journey</p>
